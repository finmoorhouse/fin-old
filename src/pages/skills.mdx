### Film

This involve sit-down interviews or on-location footage. See for example a <Link to="/portfolio/stu"> series of films </Link> I recently made telling the story of a guest of The Mountain Way charity. Nowadays, most my time is spent editing (in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere.html" target='blank'>Premiere</a>).

I have also covered sports events with <a href="https://strengthindepth.com/" target='blank'>Strength in Depth</a> and the <a href="http://europeanfitnessleague.com/" target="blank">European Fitness League</a>. That involved shooting and editing heats on the fly, so they could get shared throughout the day. I also have some experience covering (and photographing) presentations and conferences.

### Coding

This is mostly **web design and development**. I would say I'm fairly familiar with HTML, JS, CSS, Sass, React, and GatsbyJS. I'm somewhat (> 10 hours) familiar with Google Analytics, WordPress, and Firebase. I'm currently learning some data science tools in Python and getting to grips with Node.

See the <a href="https://alysonhallett.com/" target='blank'>website</a> I made for poet and author Alyson Hallett for an example of my web design, or <a href="https://www.finmoorhouse.com/portfolio/shopping-list" target='blank'>this web app</a> for a full-stack example.

I am also interested in **data visualisation**, primarily in Python and <a href="https://www.tableau.com/en-gb" target='blank'>Tableau</a>; although I'm curious to learn <a href="https://d3js.org/" target='blank'>D3</a> too.

### Animation

I make animations ranging from small logo animations ('idents') to more sophisticated motion graphics. They can work as standalone pieces, or integrated into a film. Most of this is done in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/aftereffects.html" target='blank'>AfterÂ Effects</a>.

### Graphic Design

This includes posters, logos, and social media output. A good example of this is my work for the <Link to="/portfolio/union">Cambridge Union</Link>. These designs can be used as a starting point for animations. Most of this is done in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/aftereffects.html" target='blank'>Photoshop</a>; and to a lesser extent <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html" target='blank'>Illustrator</a>and <a href="hhttps://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html" target='blank'>InDesign</a>. Iâ€™m also starting to learn <a href="https://www.figma.com" target='blank'>Figma</a>.

### Podcasting

Through setting up <a href="https://hearthisidea.com/" target='blank'>Hear This Idea</a>, I'm now fairly proficient with the basics of podcasting:  audio engineering, hosting, remote interviews, etc.
