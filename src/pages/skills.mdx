# What I Do

As a creative, I mostly divide my time between **video** and **design**.

## Video

I have been making films since my 15th birthday. I began making short narrative films, and then learned animation and motion graphics.

### Animation

I have made animations ranging from small logo animations ('idents') to more sophisticated motion graphics, to a full short film.

### Event Coverage

I have covered a few years' worth of fast-paced sports events with Inferno Racing and Strength in Depth. I also have experience covering presentations and conferences, with proper sound recording to boot.

## Design

## Graphic

This includes posters, logos, and social media output. An advantage of knowing about the motion graphics side of things is that a design can begin as a still image, and animated without faff.

## Web

Web design is a more recent interest. I would say at this point I'm pretty familiar with:

- HTML & css
- JavaScript fundamentals
- GatsbyJS
- Wordpress
  ...and consider these a WIP:
- React
- Django
- NodeJS

I also take photosâ€”of events and products.
