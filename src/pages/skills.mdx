### Film

This can involve shoot sit-down interviews and on-location filming â€“ like this<Link to="/portfolio/stu"> series of films </Link> I made for The <a href="http://mountainway.org/" target='blank'>MountainÂ Way</a> charity. Nowadays, I mostly edit things â€“ like this <a href="https://youtu.be/kM7J56OxA6w" target='blank'>recentÂ video</a> about superconductors. I have also covered <a href="https://strengthindepth.com/" target='blank'>sportsÂ events</a>, presentations, and conferences.

<br/>

### Coding

This is mostly **web design and development**. I'm fairly familiar with HTML, JS, CSS, Sass, React, and GatsbyJS. I'm somewhat (> 20 hours each) familiar with Google Analytics, WordPress, and Firebase. I'm currently getting to grips with NodeJS.

See the <a href="https://alysonhallett.com/" target='blank'>website</a> I made for poet and author Alyson Hallett for an example of my web design, or <a href="https://www.finmoorhouse.com/portfolio/shopping-list" target='blank'>this web app</a> for a full-stack example.

I am also interested in **data visualisation**, primarily in Python and <a href="https://www.tableau.com/en-gb" target='blank'>Tableau</a>; although I'm curious to learn <a href="https://d3js.org/" target='blank'>D3</a> too.

<br/>

### Animation

I make animations ranging from small logo animations ('idents') to more sophisticated motion graphics. They can work as standalone pieces, or integrated into a film. Most of this is done in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/aftereffects.html" target='blank'>AfterÂ Effects</a>.

<br/>

### Graphic Design

This includes posters, logos, and social media output. A good example of this is my work for the <Link to="/portfolio/union">Cambridge Union</Link>.

<br/>

### Podcasting

Through setting up <a href="https://hearthisidea.com/" target='blank'>Hear This Idea</a>, I'm now fairly proficient with the basics of podcasting:  audio engineering, hosting, remote interviews, etc. I enjoy consulting on this â€” <Link to="/contact">email</Link> me for rates (pro bono if you're a nonprofit).

See my <Link to="/portfolio">portfolio</Link> for more.

### Speaking

I have delivered talks on mostly philosophical subjects, especially [longtermism](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/longtermism), and especially to local [EA groups](https://eahub.org/groups/). I was shortlisted to deliver a [TEDx talk](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/18899) on the value of teaching philosophy in schools.
