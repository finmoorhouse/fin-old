# What I Do

<hr />

I mostly divide my time between video and design.

### Film

For the most part, this involves telling stories with a camera. This could involve sit-down interviews or on-location footage. See for example a <Link to="/portfolio/stu"> series of films </Link> I recently made telling the story of a guest of The Mountain Way charity.

### Animation

I make animations ranging from small logo animations ('idents') to more sophisticated motion graphics. They can work as standalone pieces, or integrated into a film.

### Event Coverage

I have covered sports events with <a href="https://strengthindepth.com/" target='blank'>Strength in Depth</a> and the <a href="http://europeanfitnessleague.com/" target="blank">European Fitness League</a>. That involved shooting and editing heats on the fly, so they could get shared throughout the day. I also have some experience covering (and photographing) presentations and conferences.

### Graphic Design

This includes posters, logos, and social media output. A good example of this is my work for the <Link to="/portfolio/union">Cambridge Union</Link>. These designs can be used as a starting point for animations.

### Web Design

More recently, I've started to properly learn web design and development. I would say at this point I'm fairly familiar with:

- HTML & css
- JavaScript fundamentals
- GatsbyJS
- WordPress

The rest are a work in progress:

- React
- Python
  - Django
- NodeJS

See the website I made for poet and author Alyson Hallett for an example. I also take photosâ€”of events and products.
