subtitle: Should we donate to causes like global health and poverty relief over very long-term causes because we can be more certain that they do good?
---

It is natural to sort the efforts and enterprises of endorsed by the 'effective altruism' movement into two kinds. On the one hand, there are the shorter-term, higher-certainty and more measurable efforts of (for instance) global health, animal welfare charities, and famine relief. When we donate to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, we can be very certain that our money will be going towards a cause that will have a guaranteed positive and almost immediate impact on a person or group of people. On the other hand, there are the longer-term, low-certainty, and less measurable efforts of mitigating risks and trying to change the likely shape of the 'long-term' future; often collected under the umbrella of 'long-termism'. Even the most fervent evangelists for prioritising extinction-risk mitigation would be unlikely to have a credence of above, say, 20% that some given risk will actually manifest. It is _likely_, on their view, that the time and resources invested in mitigating extinction risk should, in retrospect, have better been allocated elsewhere. Yet, most people sympathetic to the effective altruist movement, and indeed most people in general, see the very significant value to long-term efforts characterised by extinction-risk mitigation. In the abstract, we might even happily accept that neither kind of cause has a claim to crowd out the importance of the other. Yet, when deciding which of these broad kinds of activity to care about and even donate time or resources to, very many of us will say something along these lines:

> Sure, I can appreciate that long-term and low-certainty initiatives are important in the abstract. But personally, I just want to _know_ that I'm doing some measurable and guaranteed amount of good to real people _today_. Long-termism is too speculative and academic to trump the very real and very pressing problems of poverty and suffering right now. So I choose to donate my money or time to those causes.

I think the same thing. I can't quite shake the feeling of the _urgency of now_; almost to the extent that it trumps long-term considerations. But I think there is an argument that might undermine this feeling, at least to some degree. The argument says, if it is right, that the first family of causes are actually _less certain_ to have a positive impact in the long-run than the second family of _long-termist_ causes. So if we are after certainty, if we are risk-averse about our charitable giving, we ought to give to those long-termist causes.

Presumably the consequences of our choices matter: they should make some difference to whether we make those choices. Perhaps they are the only thing that matter. It is also plausible that the fact that the consequences happen closer to or further away from the act in time should not be morally significant: the relevant consequences include _all_ the consequences of the action, _throughout time_. Now, we are normally able to predict the short-term consequences of an act quite well. The further out in time we try to forecast, the less accurate we become. That is the least controversial claim on this page: we are not good at foreseeing all the long-term consequences of our actions. Yet, that has huge significance

- See how that works?
- Am i convinced? Not sure.
