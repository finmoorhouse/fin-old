[This](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/blog/reading-listening-and-viewing-lists-for-altruism/) article with a quote about Obama:

> In the documentary ‘The Final Year’ President Obama explains this  influence as follows: “Sometimes we think people are motivated only by  money, or they’re only motivated by power, these very concrete  incentives. But, people are also inspired by stories…So it’s worthwhile  to listen to other people and ask them questions about the stories that  are important to them”.
