For a long time, my impression of blogging as a medium was equivalent to my impression of the telegram or VHS. I guessed blogs had their time in the cultural-relevance sun in the 2000s, during the ‘wild west’ days of the internet, but they were replaced by YouTube vlogging, institutional news outlets, and podcasts. Well, I was wrong.

It turns out there is a burgeoning and expansive world of blogs floating around ‘effective-altruism’ and related ideas in the social sciences, philosophy, econ, etc. I study philosophy, and it is particularly interesting to see familiar questions treated in totally different ways.

IDW ‘hub’ but also EA etc.

This will not be the first or last time anybody will put together such a list, but I thought it might nonetheless be useful to organise the blogs I have discovered so far, roughly arranged by topic. I will revisit this and add to it if and when I discover deserving additions! I hope someone finds this useful, and discovers at least one blog or writer they didn’t know about. Please email me if you have more suggestions.
