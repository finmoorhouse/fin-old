Until recently I had the impression that blogging had long since gone the way of the radio or VHS. I guessed blogs had their time in the culturally-relevant sun in the 2000s, during the world wide web’s ‘wild west’ days. I guessed they had long since been replaced by YouTube, podcasts, institutional news outlets. Not so, it turns out.

At least for effective altruism ‘types’, so much of the conversation is taking place on forums and in long-form blog posts. There is a burgeoning and already extensive ‘cloud’ of blogs kind of loosely floating around EA and related ideas (could there be a way to [visualise this](http://redditstuff.github.io/sna/selfposts.html)?). Studying philosophy, it is especially interesting to see old questions tackled by this scrutinising and profoundly nerdy bunch of people with a speed and resourcefulness that far outstrips the stale pace of academic journals. There are costs and benefits here - mistakes are more likely to be made and assumptions unexamined on the one hand; but crazy-sounding new ideas are more likely to be generated without the specter of peer-review.

I thought it might would be useful to organise the blogs I have discovered and enjoyed so far, roughly arranged by topic. I will revisit this and add to it when I have more to add. Some are not remotely EA related but seem to fit in with the crowd, at least to my own lights. I hope someone finds this useful, and discovers at least one blog or writer they didn’t know about. Please email me if you have more suggestions.

## Philosophy

- Eric Schwitzgebel - [The Splintered Mind](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/)
- Eric is a philosopher, mostly of mind, at U. C. Berkeley. He writes about sci-fi, some very empirically-oriented philosophy, and some experimental philosophy. Particularly well-known for his (skeptical) views about introspection, and some research about whether philosophers of ethics are especially ethical (no, it turns out).
- [The X-Phi Blog](https://xphiblog.com/)
  - Experimental philosophy has a shaky reputation among philosophers, but if you’re into it you’re into it. Schwitzgebel is a contributing writer.
- Maria Popova - [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.or)
  - Lumped in with philosophy blogs but so much more. Not EA-oriented either, but I have to include it because it’s **amazing**.
