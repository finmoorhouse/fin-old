# Note I am writing this [in a google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0QyGz2z70m_ZY3u2S8cHxFIJMkvCZFSSzkE0yCIcnc/edit#heading=h.gh19vsjagia6) now

I recently wrote about some [EA projects I'd like to see](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/ea-projects) (also on the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8ic7KcxyfchhmGP3x/ea-projects-i-d-like-to-see)). I think this went fairly well

## tk Something something airborne disease

Tk to do (this is just a copy paste currently)

- Here’s one way to prompt some ideas for scalable biosafety projects: after we figured out the germ theory of disease, we make big steps towards controlling and even eliminating the spread of **waterborne diseases**. For instance, we built sewage systems to sort wastewater. And we eventually developed norms and instincts about drinking only clean water, etc. What are the analogous projects for controlling and even eliminating the spread of **airborne diseases**?
- Conceptually, we can slice this up into: (i) systems for **detecting** airborne diseases, or some proxy for them; (ii) systems for **ventilating** air; and (iii) systems for **filtering** air.
- Here’s a story we could tell about a world in which technology/norms/regulations have largely curtailed the spread of airborne diseases. The country is the UK, and the year is, suppose, 2040 —
- - **Metagenomic sequencing** technology has reached the point where most businesses, schools, and public buildings are equipped with a small sequencing device, much like a carbon monoxide alarm. Perhaps most homes are also fitted with this device.

  - Air sanitation **standards** have been introduced. Government regulation mandates some minimum measure of air cleanliness, or otherwise penalises dirty air. There is therefore a larger market for filtration systems, and for ventilation systems.

  - - Perhaps there is an agreed-on measure of air quality (wrt airborne disease), like some kind of ‘ppm/concentration of pathogenic material’.
    - It could be required that new builds fully meet some additional standards — e.g. they are already fitted with a ventilation system.

  - As a consequence, much like how plumbers will fit houses to a boiler by adapting some of the plumbing, there are also **services to adapt houses for cleaner/sanitised air**; such as by installing a system of air ducts, rather than just putting a HEPA filter in the corner of a room.

  - - Initially, installing these services are subsidised.

    - Plausibly, many of the best ways to improve air quality is not through cutting-edge technology, but rather through **‘boring’ but highly scalable adaptations** and even infrastructure projects.

    - - For instance, perhaps it might eventually become possible to **access filtered air on the ‘mains’**, like how almost every home is connected to a source of natural gas and water.

    - But tying standards to the measure of cleanliness, rather than particular fixes, gives space for a **market** for different approaches, and innovation therein.

  - These ‘metagenomic detectors’ form a massive **detection network**, such that they can work as a first line of defence for alerting to novel pathogens.

  - Many homes will be surrounded by much cleaner air, such that ventilation should be a priority. But others, especially in dense urban environments, might also want to filter incoming air. These homes might employ systems similar to how **cars and aeroplanes** recycle a high throughput of air.
- How might we get there? What might intermediate stages look like?
- - Initially, **CO2 detectors might work as a good proxy** for air quality w.r.t airborne disease (because higher CO2 concentrations are likely to come from other people’s breathing).

  - - Plus, it would just generally be useful to have a world in which people are more sensitive to CO2 (and CO) concentrations, because of the effects of CO/CO2 (stuffy air) on **cognitive function**.
    - One nice common feature of having widespread air quality measurement is that people can **learn instincts and norms** around improving air quality. For instance, some people who use CO2 monitors eventually become more sensitive to when a room feels ‘stuffy’, and when a room appears poorly ventilated such that they can expect it will feel stuffy. And similar dynamics occur for blood glucose monitors and thermometers. And for becoming sensitive to touching one’s face, or shaking hands, because of Covid guidelines.

  - A major and obvious assumption here is that metagenomic sequencing technology will become **more affordable by at least a couple orders of magnitude**. But this doesn’t seem unreasonable, because (i) it’s hard to think of obvious engineering impediments, and (ii) the gap between where we are and when the tech is marketable isn’t *so* large that nobody has an incentive to work on developing it (even if the initial work will be nonprofit).

  - But there will be a point where the sequencing technology is affordable enough to be used in some government standards, but too expensive to be permanently installed in most businesses / buildings / homes. In this case, you could imagine **inspectors** who visit on the order of every couple years to take samples of air from buildings, and mandate changes (e.g. some government subsidised filtration system) if the readings are bad (analogous to fire safety inspections).

  - In order to bite, **governments** need to stand behind these standards and regulations. Is this politically viable? Plausibly. If this kind of system would just pay for itself as a public health measure, it would clearly be in a country’s interest to roll out. And there aren’t major coordination or free-rider problems.

  - - These few years after Covid could be a good period to draw up interest, given the peak in interest in preparedness/biosafety measures (and that this will probably subside in the years following). In general, it’s surprising that air filtration and ventilation has not become more widely discussed or adopted.

  - Different components could vary widely in cost. For instance, a household metagenomic sequencer or air quality monitor could cost on the order of $20–$100. But fully retrofitting a large building with filtration or ventilation could cost $10,000s. And doing things like “fitting infrastructure to have ‘clean air on the mains’ “ could cost hundreds of millions or more (though it’s very unclear if this *specific* idea would even make sense).
- Some overall reflections —
- - Some of the value of this kind of exercise is just to map the conceptual space of biosafety interventions, which can be a little illegible from the outside.
- Many parts of this picture are likely to be wrong, but if even something like it turns out to be correct, then it seems plausible that EA could speed up adoption by around 5 years.
  - - That could involve **advocating** and **lobbying** for air quality standards;
  - And it could also involve doing the **R&D** to drive down the cost of the key technology (especially metagenomic sequencing

## Spoken word content

In a [recent forum post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sxEcd6PAQkWiH7edd/two-podcast-opportunities), I wrote —

>  I think there's a strong case for recording more existing EA content  as podcasts. The main reason is that this will help more people engage  with more content, because there are times when it's much easier to  listen to versus read the same writing.

> I'm glad to see some recent progress. The [Nonlinear Library](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JTZTBienqWEAjGDRv/listen-to-more-ea-content-with-the-nonlinear-library) popped up a couple months ago, which uses text-to-speech software to  create an automatically updating repository of audio content. The [EA Forum Podcast](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oXt66Ny6FCoATKasn/the-ea-forum-podcast-is-up-and-running) is also great, especially because genuine spoken word still beats TTS.
