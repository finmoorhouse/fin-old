Like (I assume) almost everyone, I think of ideas for things to research or write about faster than I'm able to research or write about them. More generally, I think there is a big 'idea overhang' in effective altruism and [global priorities research](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/) specifically. So I've written some ideas down, half just to remind myself what I'd like to write about, and half in case such a list could be a useful source of ideas. I also encourage others to do this more! ([Here's one example](http://logangraham.xyz/blog/Papers-You-Should-Write))

### Ethics in many worlds

If the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics were true, would that imply anything for how we should act (compared to if it weren't true)?
