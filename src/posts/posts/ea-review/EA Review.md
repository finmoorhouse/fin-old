I recently picked up a fairly recent collection of articles on philosophical topics in effective altruism, called Effective Altruism – Philosophical Issues. I really enjoyed it, and figured it might be useful to try summarising each chapter—in part because I think trying to publicly explain something you've learned it a good test that you've actually understood it; and in part because there's a chance that somebody out there might be interested in reading such a summary. There are fifteen chapters, starting with…

## 1. The Definition of Effective Altruism — Will MacAskill
A natural place to start. As a first pass, you might associate ‘effective altruism’ with three broad components:

1. The **intellectual** project of using reason and evidence to identifying most effective approaches, methods, initiatives, and cause areas for doing good or improving lives — where ‘improving lives’ and ‘doing good’ and construed in [welfarist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#Wel) terms.
2. The **practical** project (and associated global movement) of following through on (1) and volunteering significant time, money, or resources to implement such ideas and actually do good.
3. A bunch of normative claims to the effect that people have obligations to engage with either (1) or (1) and (2).
   - *Weakly — *if* you’re planning on giving to charity with a view to doing good, you have an obligation to  consider and value effectiveness.
   - *Strong* — you have a general obligation to do good, construed in welfarist terms.

The potential surprise here is that MacAskill goes in for a definition of ‘effective altruism’ that neglects (3). This is the nutshell definition given by the Centre for Effective Altruism:

> Effective altruism is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis.

There is, fittingly, a very practical reason for avoiding effective altruism’s normative dimensions — because ‘obligation’ talk is likely to be off-putting, irrespective of its truth. MacAskill cites the experience of the founders of Giving What We Can, who found that framing effective altruism as an “opportunity” to large amounts of good was, well, more effective than framing it as a kind of “obligation”. Whether this is borne out more widely remains to be seen.

## 2. The Moral Imperative Toward Cost-Effectiveness in Global Health — Toby Ord

This is an early early landmark for effective altruism, written by the founder of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/). he idea is straightforward: in discussing the ethics of global health,  cost-effectiveness might strike many as a technical afterthought  relative to considerations of justice, equality etc. But just learning  about the stark differences in cost-effectiveness between interventions  in the same area—sometimes many orders of magnitude—is enough to dispel  this impression. The plain facts here speak so loudly that commentary or philosophising  is almost unnecessary: for instance, “the least effective HIV/AIDS  intervention produces less than 0.1 per cent of the value of the most  effective”. It features an even clearer example which distils the key driving intuition of the priority of cost-effectiveness. I’ve used it in the past as an introduction to EA — it’s just enough to drive home the “aha” moment. It involves comparing expenditure on guide dogs with eye surgeries undoing damage from [trachoma](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trachoma):

>Suppose we have a $40,000 budget which we can spend as we wish to fight blindness. One thing we could do is to provide guide dogs to blind people in the United States to help them overcome their disability. This costs about \$40,000 due to the training required for the dog and its recipient. Another option is to pay for surgeries to reverse the effects of trachoma in Africa. This costs less than \$20 per patient cured… We could thus use our entire budget to provide a single guide dog, helping one person overcome the challenges of blindness, or we could use it to cure more than 2,000 people of blindness. If we think that people have equal moral value, then the second option is more than 2,000 times better than the first. Put another way, the first option squanders about 99.95% of the value that we could have produced.

It’s worth noting that since this paper’s original publication, the claims made in the passage quoted above have been scrutinised. See [this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ/fact-checking-comparison-between-trachoma-surgeries-and) for some fact checking.

## 3. Evidence Neutrality and the Moral Value of Information — Amanda Askell

When choosing among interventions with equivalent expected value, is there ever good reason to back the intervention with the *least* evidential support—i.e. the most speculative such interventions? Spoiler: yes! And for fascinating and convincing reasons!

The piece begins with a distinction between two features of evidence:

- **Balance** — whether, and to what extent, the evidence supports the claim $\phi$.
- **Weight** — the total amount of evidence relevant to the claim $\phi$.

Correspondingly, you might have a…

- **Credence**  — a number from 0 to 1 indicating how likely you find some claim $\phi$ to be. Your credence itself has a…
- **Resilience** — how stable we expect our credence to be after learning new evidence.
