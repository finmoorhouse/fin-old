I recently picked up a fairly recent collection of articles on philosophical topics in effective altruism, called Effective Altruism – Philosophical Issues. I really enjoyed it, and figured it might be useful to try summarising each chapter—in part because I think trying to publicly explain something you've learned it a good test that you've actually understood it; and in part because there's a chance that somebody out there might be interested in reading such a summary. There are fifteen chapters, starting with:

## 1. The Definition of Effective Altruism — Will MacAskill
A natural place to start. 

## 2. The Moral Imperative Toward Cost-Effectiveness in Global Health — Toby Ord

## 3. Evidence Neutrality and the Moral Value of Information — Amanda Askell
