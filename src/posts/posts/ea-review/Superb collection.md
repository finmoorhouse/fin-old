Superb collection. Greaves and Pummer have choosen and comission articles on a surprisingly wide variety of topics, and from a real diversity of (sometimes critical) perspectives. We have familiar views rehearsed or reprinted from central figures in the effective altruism movement; and some propely illuminating new 'outsider' perspectives.

The first two chapters cover some of the basic motivations, misconceptions, and terminology associated with effective altruism. In “The Definition of Effective Altruism”, Will MacAskill outlines and defends the Centre for Effective Altruism's definition:
<blockquote>Effective altruism is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis.</blockquote>
Note the potentially surprising absence of any claim to the effect that you <i>should</i> do so! Toby Ord's “The Moral Imperative Toward Cost-Effectiveness in Global Health” was an early landmark: the stark comparisons between measures of effectiveness . I thought this was clear and compelling enough to refer to anybody curious about the ideas which underpin effective altruism.

In “Evidence Neutrality and the Moral Value of Information”, Amanda Askell asks: when choosing among interventions with equivalent expected value, is there ever good reason to back the intervention with the <i>least</i> evidential backing—the most speculative such interventions? (Spolier: yes.) The next article was also about evidence and information, but as applied to personal decisions. Lauri Paul's recent writing about '[book:Transformative Experience|22329084]' is adapted for the context of effective altruism. The general idea is that certain experiences or changes are dramatic enough that (i) actually undergoing them is necessary for knowing what they're like; and (ii) you emerge with (substantially) new preferences, sense of identity, or beliefs. As applied: how should an aspiring effective altruist plan her career if she hasn't the experience to make an informed decision, nor the time to try every alternative?

EXAMPLE OF MONEY?

In “Should We Give to More Than One Charity?”, James Snowden asks: (unsurprisingly) should we give to one charity? Snowden's answer, counterintuitive but tricky to dispute, is <i>no</i>. Provided you're not a billionaire—in which case, refer to the original text for guidance.

The following couple of chapters delve in to cause prioritisation. Nick Beckstead effectively presents a SparkNotes summary of his <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research">thesis</a> arguing for the overwhelming importance of the far future. This piece made tangible an idea which is often to hard to grasp intuitively, even if you find it conceptually watertight.
QUOTE FROM BECKSTEAD
Next comes “Effective Altruism, Global Poverty, and Systemic Change”, in which Iason Gabriel and Brian McElwee make the case that the effective altruism movement has largely overlooked a class of causes that sit halfway between existential risk reduction (i.e. Beckstead) and narrowly targeted and epistemically secure interventions in global health. The former class address potentially enormous payoffs or losses with correspondingly slim probabilities and / or confidence. The latter address lesser payoffs, but with few unknowns and backed by RCTs and other clear empirical data. Addressing global poverty via <i>systemic change</i> falls somewhere in the middle: such efforts are likely to be

Superb collection. Greaves and Pummer have choosen and comission articles on a surprisingly wide variety of topics, and from a real diversity of (sometimes critical) perspectives.

Note the potentially surprising absence of any claim to the effect that you <i>should</i> do so! Toby Ord's “The Moral Imperative Toward Cost-Effectiveness in Global Health” was an early landmark for effective altruism: the stark comparisons between measures of effectiveness speak so loudly that they're basically sufficient to make the case minus any commentary philosophising. I thought this was clear and compelling enough to refer to anybody curious about the ideas which underpin effective altruism.

In “Evidence Neutrality and the Moral Value of Information”, Amanda Askell asks: when choosing among interventions with equivalent expected value, is there ever good reason to back the intervention with the <i>least</i> evidential backing—the most speculative such interventions?

As applied: how should an aspiring effective altruist plan her career if she hasn't the experience to make an informed decision, nor the time to try every alternative? Should she 'earn to give' if her future hedge-fund-manager-self drops writes off her original intention as naive, youthful optimism?

The following couple of chapters delve in to cause prioritisation. Nick Beckstead effectively presents a SparkNotes summary of his <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research">thesis</a> arguing for the overwhelming importance of the far future. This piece made tangible an idea which is often to hard to grasp intuitively, even if you find it conceptually watertight. Here's the back-of-the-envelope calculation: let's say (conservatively) humanity has a 1% chance of surviving for another billion years. This will almost certainly involve developing the technology for colonising space—so <i>conditional</i> on surviving that long, let's say humanity again has at least a 1% chance of spreading through the stars and surviving for 100 <i>trillion</i> years. The expected duration of humanity's overall lifespan is therefore 1% × 1% × 100 trillion = <i>10 billion years</i>. Blimey. 

Next comes “Effective Altruism, Global Poverty, and Systemic Change”, in which Iason Gabriel and Brian McElwee make the case that the effective altruism movement has largely overlooked a class of causes that sit halfway between existential risk reduction (i.e. Beckstead) and narrowly targeted and epistemically secure interventions in global health. The former class address potentially enormous payoffs or losses with correspondingly slim probabilities and / or confidence. The latter address lesser payoffs, but with few unknowns and backed by RCTs and other clear empirical data. Addressing global poverty via <i>systemic change</i> falls somewhere in the middle along both dimensions. The authors cite books like [book:Blood Oil|25735903] and [book:Why Nations Fail|12158480] as identifying such neglected systemic causes of poverty—like global supply chains sustaining authoritarian regimes, and tax evasion which "deprives countries of vast capital flows that could be used to improve the lives of their citizens" and contrbutes to about one quarter of global GDP going untaxed. Seeking out systemic change (i) seems somewhat tractable and achievable; (ii) promises huge potential payoffs, and (iii) answers the charge that more targeted and practical interventions (bednets, nutritional supplements...) 'plaster over' symptoms of deeper ingrained, systemic causes. It isn't immediately clear, then, why more effective altruists are not more interested in systemic change. One explanation—mere risk aversion—clearly won't stick, given the popularity of existential risk reduction. Gabriel and McElwee point instead to an aversion to taking political sides (broadly construed). Thus
<blockquote>[T]he greatest positive impacts on the world can be achieved not through iterated small-scale interventions, but rather through systemic initiatives that alter the rules within which actors operate and that challenge the values that underpin them. Exerting even small leverage over very large systems could in principle have much greater impact than efforts to optimize within the status quo.</blockquote>
I think this was my favourite of the bunch—challenging and convincing.

Next, Emma Saunders-Hastings defends the persistent worry that effective altruism, in the context of aid interventions, is objectionably paternalistic. I liked that this was tackled from multiple angles. Some I didn't quite understand; others made a whole lot of sense.

They also note, and the historical record apparently bears out, that few equivalently big-and-scary social problems are righted without advocacy movements and targeted campaigns and initiatives. I learned, for instance, about one such itivative called Global Witness:
<blockquote>...founded in 1993 to help tackle illicit financial flows to authoritarian regimes, including the trade in blood diamonds. Operating with an annual budget of several thousand dollars, the organization spearheaded efforts to establish the Kimberly Process for diamond certification and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize as a result of its efforts. More recently, it was the driving force behind the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an endeavour which has led corporations to publicize trillions of dollars of previously hidden financial transactions.</blockquote>
