The Packhorse Pub in Bath is a 600 year-old building at the centre of the village of South Stoke. In 2015, it was shut down and the owner threatened to turn it into a residential building. While applications to change it were blocked by the village, the building fell into disrepair.

However, a group of committed volunteers in the village began an effort to buy it back as a community. So began a lengthy and heroic effort to raise the funds needed to place the Packhorse back at the centre of village life.

This is the story I want to tell in the film I am working on about the pub. I started filming for it more than three years ago, and I am editing it now.

When it's finished, I'll update this page. Stay tuned.
