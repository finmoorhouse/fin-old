[Liv Boeree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Boeree) is a science communicator and former professional poker player. She is a World Series of Poker and European Poker Tour champion, and is the only female player in history to win both a WSOP bracelet and an EPT event. In 2014, Boeree co-founded [Raising for Effective Giving](https://reg-charity.org/), an organization that encourages poker players to donate to effective charities, and provides resources to that end. As of July 2020, Raising for Effective Giving has raised over $14,000,000 for its supported charities.

Having retired from pro poker, Liv now [gives talks](https://www.ted.com/talks/liv_boeree_3_lessons_on_decision_making_from_a_poker_champion?language=en) and makes videos for her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LivBoeree/videos), explaining ideas in science, futurism, and [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).

On an ongoing and part-time basis, I help Liv with planning, editing, and animations for her videos; plus general research. Below is a video I'm proud to have helped with, about room-temperature superconductors.
