I've thrown together more minor bit of work on this page.

## Every Child

_Every Child_ is a short film I made in 2012 with my little sister which I submitted to the Future8 awards, a UK and Ireland-wide technology competition. I was lucky enough to win the film category, and attended an award ceremony at the Google campus in London. You can read about the prize <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/future-8-tech-teenagers-awards" target="blank">here</a>, or watch the film <a href="https://vimeo.com/81748636" target="blank">here</a>.

## Classics Film Competition

I made a film with a friend for the Cambridge Classics department's annual film competition, judged by Mary Beard. The film explained the origins and significance of the Proto-Indo-European language. It came runner up, and we both won a book! You can watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/qYb8A3h-U_M" target="blank">here</a>.

## Untitled Podcast

I'm currently working on a podcast featuring long-form interviews with academics about their recent publications. I can't say much more about it because at this stage there isn't much more to say; stay tuned!

## Photography

You can see most of my photography from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/finmoorhouse" target="blank">here</a>, although that hasn't been updated in a while.
