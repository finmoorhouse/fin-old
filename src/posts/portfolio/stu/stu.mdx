The Mountain Way was founded by Andy Shaw, a retired Royal Marine and veteran of the Falkands and Northern Ireland conflicts. Andy suffered from PTSD for 30 years before he was able to overcome his “silent wound”. He now takes military veterans suffering from PTSD on 10-day, one-to-one trips in the French Pyrenees with the aim of resolving their own condition.

Stuart came to The Mountain Way having in the aftermath of an IED incident in Afghanistan. His time with Andy was miraculously effective, and he was able to return to his family stronger and more optimistic.

I filmed Stuart to promote the Mountain Way and tell his story. His account of events, on and off the camera, was candid and astonishing. We were all very grateful to be able to share his story and the Mountain Way cause.

The films themselves were broken into six sub-sections, centring on a talking-head interview with Stuart, and images from his trip.
